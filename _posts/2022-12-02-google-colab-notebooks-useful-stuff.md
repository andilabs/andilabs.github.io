# INTRO

Is there something more lovely than having python interpreter accessible via web browser with jupyter  on whatever computer with just internet access?

I know jupyter notebooks (and jupyterhub instance as server for creating and running notebooks in my company) but having it offered as part of Google free services was great surprise!
