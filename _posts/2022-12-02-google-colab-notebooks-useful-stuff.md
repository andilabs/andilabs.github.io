# INTRO

Is there something more lovely than having python interpreter accessible via web browser with jupyter  on whatever computer with just internet access?

I know jupyter notebooks (and jupyterhub instance as server for creating and running notebooks in my company) but having it offered as part of Google free services was great surprise!

# my personal use cases:
* playing with new libraries
* automating borning staff (e.g paying monthly taxes, bills by generating payments package I just upload in online banking, automated messaging of customers) 
* debugging
* consuming 3-rd party API-s
* visualizing data by ploting graphs
#  getting started

# installing libs, checking whats already there
