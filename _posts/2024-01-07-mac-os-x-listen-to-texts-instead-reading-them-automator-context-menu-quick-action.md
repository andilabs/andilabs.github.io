title: Mac OS X convert text to speech (automator context menu Quick Action) and add
  it to playlist in Music.app

I like running.

I like reading longr, more in depth text and analysis e.g regarding economy or social policies.

This workflow takes selected text and converts text to speech using apple text to speech and adds recording straight into Music.app (old iTunes) to the selected playlist.

The last "manual" bit is taking care to sync it of course to old school iPod classic (without internet and all the bullshit distractors)
