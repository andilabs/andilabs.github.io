I like running.

I like reading longr, more in depth text and analysis e.g regarding economy or social policies.

This workflow dumps read up'ed using apple text to speech straight into Musica.app (old iTunes) into certain playlist.

The last "manual" bit is taking care to sync it of course to old school iPod classic (without internet and all bullshit distractors)
